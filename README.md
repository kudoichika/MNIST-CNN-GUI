# MNIST Digit GUI

A very simple Qt/Python GUI to physically test my MNIST Digit Recognition CNN algorithm. Current version in the [Python folder](https://github.com/kudoichika/NumberRecognizer/tree/master/Python%20(New)) that contains both the GUI design and the current [CNN model](https://github.com/kudoichika/NumberRecognizer/tree/master/Python%20(New)/CNN). 

The old C++ version uses the Armadillo linear algebra library and a DNN algorithm with a much lower accuracy.
